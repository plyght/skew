# Skew

A tiling window manager for macOS written in Rust, inspired by [sway](https://swaywm.org/) and [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai).

## Features

- **Smart Focus Management**: Directional navigation, focus-follows-mouse, intelligent window filtering
- **Real macOS Integration**: Native Accessibility API bindings for window control and monitoring
- **Global Hotkeys**: System-wide keyboard shortcuts with customizable key bindings
- **Multi-Display Support**: Automatic display detection and per-monitor layout management
- **IPC Communication**: Full CLI-daemon communication for seamless control
- **Robust Configuration**: TOML, JSON, and YAML support with comprehensive validation
- **Plugin System**: Extensible with Lua scripting support
- **CLI Interface**: Complete command-line tools for control and automation
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and clean architecture

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- **macOS**: Requires macOS 10.12+ with Accessibility API support
- **Permissions**: **Critical** - Accessibility permissions must be granted for window management

### Granting Accessibility Permissions

1. Open **System Preferences** â†’ **Security & Privacy** â†’ **Privacy** â†’ **Accessibility**
2. Click the lock icon and enter your password
3. Add the Skew binary to the list and enable it
4. Restart Skew after granting permissions

Without accessibility permissions, Skew will run in limited mode with reduced functionality.

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/plyght/skew.git
cd skew

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Install binaries
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

### Starting Skew

```bash
# Start with default configuration
skew start

# Start with custom config file
skew --config ~/.config/skew/custom.toml start
```

### Managing the Service

```bash
# Check status
skew status

# Reload configuration
skew reload

# Stop the service
skew stop
```

### Configuration

Default configuration location: `~/.config/skew/config.toml`

Example configuration:

```toml
[general]
gap = 10.0
border_width = 2.0
border_color = "#cccccc"
active_border_color = "#0080ff"

[layout]
default_layout = "bsp"  # bsp, stack, grid, spiral, column, monocle, float
split_ratio = 0.6

[focus]
follows_mouse = true
mouse_delay_ms = 100

[hotkeys]
mod_key = "alt"

[hotkeys.bindings]
"alt+h" = "focus_left"
"alt+j" = "focus_down"
"alt+k" = "focus_up"
"alt+l" = "focus_right"
"alt+shift+h" = "move_left"
"alt+shift+j" = "move_down"
"alt+shift+k" = "move_up"
"alt+shift+l" = "move_right"
"ctrl+alt+space" = "toggle_layout"
"alt+return" = "exec:terminal"
"alt+w" = "close_window"

[ipc]
socket_path = "/tmp/skew.sock"

[plugins]
enabled = []
plugin_dir = "~/.config/skew/plugins"
```

## Layout Algorithms

Skew supports 7 different tiling algorithms:

- **BSP (Binary Space Partitioning)**: Recursively splits screen space in half
- **Stack**: Master window on left, others stacked vertically on right
- **Grid**: Arranges windows in a grid pattern
- **Spiral**: First window takes main area, others spiral around it
- **Column**: All windows arranged in equal-width columns
- **Monocle**: Full-screen mode for focused window
- **Float**: Traditional floating window mode

Switch between layouts with `Ctrl+Alt+Space` or via IPC commands.

## Default Hotkeys

| Hotkey | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `Alt+H/J/K/L` | Focus window left/down/up/right |
| `Alt+Shift+H/J/K/L` | Move window left/down/up/right |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Space` | Toggle between layouts |
| `Alt+Enter` | Launch terminal |
| `Alt+W` | Close focused window |
| `Alt+Shift+Space` | Swap with main window |
| `Alt+Shift+R` | Restart/reload configuration |

All hotkeys are fully customizable in the configuration file.

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check code formatting
cargo fmt --check

# Run clippy lints
cargo clippy
```

### Features

- `default`: Includes scripting support
- `scripting`: Lua plugin system (requires `mlua`)

```bash
# Build without scripting support
cargo build --no-default-features
```

## Architecture

### Components

- **Main CLI** (`main.rs`): Command-line interface and entry point
- **Daemon** (`daemon.rs`): Background service for window management
- **Window Manager** (`window_manager.rs`): Core logic for window operations
- **Layout Engine** (`layout.rs`): Algorithms for window arrangement
- **Plugin System** (`plugins.rs`): Lua scripting integration
- **IPC** (`ipc.rs`): Communication between CLI and daemon
- **macOS Integration** (`macos/`): Platform-specific window system bindings

### Binaries

- `skew`: Main CLI interface
